                    <li><strong>Economic Constraints:</strong> Limited financial resources make it difficult to afford fresh fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods.</li>

                    <li><strong>Limited Nutrition Education:</strong> Many families lack the knowledge to make informed food choices or cook healthy meals within their budget.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Low-income families often work long hours, leaving little time for meal preparation, which leads to reliance on processed and fast foods.</li>
