            <div class="text-box">
                <h4>Key Barriers to Healthy Eating:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Constraints:</strong> Limited financial resources make it difficult to afford fresh fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Access to Healthy Food:</strong> Many low-income neighborhoods lack affordable grocery stores or farmers' markets with fresh produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Nutrition Education:</strong> Many families lack the knowledge to make informed food choices or cook healthy meals within their budget.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Low-income families often work long hours, leaving little time for meal preparation, which leads to reliance on processed and fast foods.</li>

            <div class="text-box">
                <h4>Why Diet Quality Declines in Low-Income Families:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Constraints:</strong> The cost of healthy food is often out of reach for many low-income families, leading to reliance on cheaper, calorie-dense foods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Healthy Food:</strong> In many areas, grocery stores or farmers' markets with affordable healthy food options are scarce, a situation known as a "food desert."</li>
                    <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Many families do not have access to nutrition education programs, which can lead to poor food choices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Food Deserts:</strong> Many low-income neighborhoods lack supermarkets and have limited access to healthy food, making it harder to find nutritious options.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plan Meals Ahead:</strong> Planning meals for the week can help families save money by buying in bulk and reducing food waste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shop Smart:</strong> Take advantage of sales, discounts, and coupons to buy healthy items at a lower cost. Consider buying frozen or canned vegetables, which can be cheaper than fresh produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorporate Plant-Based Foods:</strong> Beans, lentils, and other plant-based proteins are affordable and nutritious substitutes for meat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grow Your Own Food:</strong> If possible, families can grow their own vegetables or join community gardens, which can significantly reduce food costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Local Resources:</strong> Community-based programs may offer cooking classes, nutrition workshops, and food assistance to support families in eating healthy on a budget.</li>
