        <p>My goal is to provide low-income families with the resources and education needed to access and prepare healthy meals; lowering the consumption of processed and fast foods, despite financial and time constraints.</p>

            <h3>Background / My Motivation</h3>
            <p>I am a student at Paulding County High School, who has dealt with eating heavily processed and sugary foods throughout my life. My motivation also stems from the fact that this creates several disadvantages for low-income families compared to those who can afford healthier diets, leading to worse mortality rates, lower energy, and stunted growth and development in children.</p>

        <h2>Why Healthy Eating for Low-Income Families Is Important</h2>
        <p>
            Low-income families face significant challenges in maintaining healthy diets due to financial barriers, tight schedules, and limited education on nutrition. These obstacles result in a reliance on processed and fast foods, which negatively impacts their health and well-being.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Harder lives</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                This creates unfair advantages between low-income populations who can't afford a healthy diet and people who can. It affects their day-to-day lives, making it harder for them to be productive and also leading to several chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease.

        <h3>Unfair Disparities</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>
                About 13% of the U.S. population lives in low-income, low-access areas, where the nearest grocery store is over a mile away in urban settings or 10 miles away in rural areas. Additionally, food insecurity rates are significantly higher among Black and Hispanic households, nearly double those of white households. Minority populations living in these underserved areas face greater barriers to obtaining fresh, healthy food, creating disparities that further increase health issues.
